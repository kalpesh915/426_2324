       What is a Web Worker?
       When executing scripts in an HTML page, the page becomes unresponsive until the script is finished.
       A web worker is a JavaScript that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, without affecting the performance of the page. You can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the web worker runs in the background.

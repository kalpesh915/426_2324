    // The debugger Keyword
    /*
        The debugger keyword stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function.
        This has the same function as setting a breakpoint in the debugger.
        If no debugging is available, the debugger statement has no effect.
        With the debugger turned on, this code will stop executing before it executes the third line.

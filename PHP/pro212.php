        PHP Loops
        In the following chapters you will learn how to repeat code by using loops in PHP.
        
        Often when you write code, you want the same block of code to run over and over again a certain number of times. So, instead of adding several almost equal code-lines in a script, we can use loops.
        Loops are used to execute the same block of code again and again, as long as a certain condition is true.

    // loop code

    for($i=1; $i<=10; $i++){
        echo "<hr>Welcome to world of php loops";
    }

    /*
        
        while - loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true
        do...while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as the specified condition is true
        for - loops through a block of code a specified number of times
        foreach - loops through a block of code for each element in an array

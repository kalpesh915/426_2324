        PHP Loops
        In the following chapters you will learn how to repeat code by using loops in PHP.
        
        Often when you write code, you want the same block of code to run over and over again a certain number of times. So, instead of adding several almost equal code-lines in a script, we can use loops.
        Loops are used to execute the same block of code again and again, as long as a certain condition is true.
